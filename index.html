	I am a researcher at Mozilla, currently working on the <a href="http://github.com/mozilla/servo/">servo</a> parallel web browser project.<br> 
	<br>
	I recently got my Ph.D. from the University of Chicago‘s <a href="http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/">Computer Science</a> department, studying under <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/%7Ejhr/">Dr. John Reppy</a>. My Master’s paper was on the implementation of analysis and optimization passes in our parallel compiler, <a href="http://manticore.cs.uchicago.edu/">Manticore</a>.
	My Ph.D. research was on how to add mutation safely and efficiently into
	a functional parallel programming language. I've also been doing work on our runtime,
	garbage collector, and most recently some extensions to control-flow
	analysis.
	<p>Before that, over the course of seven years I was a manager and a developer at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">Visual Studio</a>
	organization, working on next-generation software development tools
	technology out at the Redmond, WA offices.</p>
