<h4>Servo</h4>
<p><a href="http://github.com/mozilla/servo/">Servo</a> is a parallel web browser. </p>
<p><a href="presentations/LinuxConUS2014.pdf">Talk</a> at LinuxCon 2014 North America on Servo and its embedding support.</p>

<h4><span></span><span></span>Manticore (OSX, Linux)</h4>
<p><a href="http://manticore.cs.uchicago.edu/">Manticore</a> is a
parallel programming language and runtime optimized for manycore
computers. It is based on the ML family of languages, extended with a
variety of explicit and implicitly-threaded parallel language features.</p>
<h4>Standard ML of New Jersey (ALL)</h4>
<p><a href="http://smlnj.org/">SML/NJ</a> is a compiler for the Standard
ML language. It is a relatively mature implementation, and most of my
work has been on minor feature polish and platform specific
optimizations and bugfixing.</p>
<h4>iDraft (iOS)</h4>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=303582334&amp;mt=8">iDraft</a>
 provided information on the 2009 NFL draft. It had breakdowns by
college player, professional team, and a list of all the free agents
then on the market.</p>
<h4>WiFi Checker (iOS)</h4>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288387104&amp;mt=8">WiFi Checker</a>
 is a simple application that scans all of the local WiFi networks.
After over 1 million downloads under the name WiFinder, Apple has
requested that I stop updating it. If you’ve got a developer key and
want to build it for yourself, the sources are available <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1620890/website/tools/WiFiChecker.zip">here</a>. Don’t reuse the artwork elsewhere.</p>
<h4>Split the Bill (iOS)</h4>
<p><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288199658&amp;mt=8">Split the Bill</a>
 is a simple application to let you enter items from, say, a restaurant
bill, assign them to the folks who were there (or as shared), and which
then breaks down the calculations of how much each person owes. One
interesting thing it does is calculate tip off of only the items you
had, not the items + tax (as most of the “tip calculator” applications
do). One of these days I’ll update it again, for those ten people a
month who purchase it by accident.</p>
<h4>Visual Studio</h4>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>
 is a suite of tools that aid in software development for the Microsoft
Windows platform. During my seven years there, I directly worked on the
Academic version, a slew of pieces of the environment (tool windows,
settings customization, upgrade between versions, UNICODE API support on
 Win9x, etc.), and completely overhauled the build and source code
control system for the division (~1200 developers at the time). As a
manager, I lead a small team in the prototyping effort that would
directly become the new text editor, lead to a slew of patents in
debugging and online tools, and did the early work building and
convincing the division that frameworks like MEF and exposing the
compiler’s internals were important.</p>
<h4>IncGoogleSearch (.NET)</h4>
<p>Back before it became trendy (circa 2002), I whipped up a tool to do incremental web search using Google’s APIs. <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1620890/website/tools/inc-google-search.jpg">Screenshot</a>, <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1620890/website/tools/IncGoogle.zip">binaries</a>, and <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1620890/website/tools/IncGoogleSrc.zip">source</a> available.</p>
<h4>Nuance (WinCE)</h4>
<p>I, with Neill Miller, put together the best <a href="http://www.thecodefactory.org/nuance/">editor</a> that ever existed on H/PC Pro devices.</p>
<h4>Scheme 48</h4>
<p><a href="http://s48.org/">Scheme 48</a> is an implementation of the Scheme programming language. I ported it to Windows, the Sony AIBO (dog) robots, Windows CE HPC/Pro devices, supported an introductory programming sequence that used it, and added ActiveX support to it.
