This blog will be devoted to research topics relevant to my job at Mozilla Research, and likely focused on Rust and Servo. My <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larsberg/">last blog</a> was similarly work-focused. During my time in graduate school, I took a bit of a break from blogging, though I actually did a <a href="http://www.lars.com/publications.html">lot</a> more writing then!
