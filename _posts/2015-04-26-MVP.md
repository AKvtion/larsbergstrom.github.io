[Fakegrimlock](http://www.fakegrimlock.com/)'s post on [Minimum Viable Personality](http://avc.com/2011/09/minimum-viable-personality/) is from 2011, but I think it's still worth revisiting when you look at new products. Especially ones like [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo), that absolutely will require winning the hearts and minds of customers in order to achieve our goals. As our [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) shows, we still have a lot of work left to do to produce viable products from Servo, but we're still far enough along for the mission, values, and enemy to be pretty clear:

## 1) HOW YOU CHANGE CUSTOMER'S LIFE?

We will bring the freedom to access your applications on any device, with great performance, delivered by the web.

## 2) WHAT YOU STAND FOR?

The mission of [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org) is to promote the open web --- not just for developers, but also for end users. We believe that no company should interfere between the user and web application developer.

## 3) WHO OR WHAT YOU HATE?

We hate native apps and their stores, particularly on mobile devices. These platforms not only lock users into their devices, but lock out both developers producing applications that do not match the image or goals of the app store owner and developers in locations that are not yet of high value to those owners.
